## :loudspeaker: About

This workshop is designed to introduce students to foundational cybersecurity concepts,
covering topics such as password protection,phishing, and virus identification. 
Through an engaging presentation and interactive discussions, participants will gain insights into safeguarding personal digital data. 
Following this, students will apply their knowledge in a hands-on game,
navigating a series of mini-games with the objective of reaching the end without falling victim to cyber threats.

## :page_with_curl: Project Description
This project was inspired by the rising number of individuals falling victim to cybersecurity threats like phishing and malware.
In response, this project aims to design and develop an engaging introductory cybersecurity game tailored for beginners. 
The game provides an interactive experience that introduces players to essential cybersecurity concepts, including phishing, password security, viruses, and antivirus measures. 
Thoughtfully designed with hints and guidance, the game helps players understand the purpose and learning objectives behind each mini-game, making cybersecurity education both accessible and enjoyable.

<!--#### Why We Chose Unity for This Project:
 * Our project leverages Unity to develop a cybersecurity-themed 2D game, aimed at simplifying cybersecurity concepts for a non-technical audience. Unity's robust 2D framework, featuring the Canvas and Tilemap systems, facilitates the creation of engaging mini-games where players interact with simulated Windows applications, teaching cybersecurity principles. The engine's extensive asset library and physics capabilities also enhance gameplay, providing dynamic and user-friendly experiences.
* We considered Unity, Blender, and Scratch as candidate for our games. Unity was the clear choice due to its strong support for 2D game mechanics, UI systems, and physics components. While Blender is excellent for 3D modeling and rendering, it lacks focus on game development logic. Scratch, though simple and accessible, does not support the depth of features we need for our game.
* Unity’s asset store offers a variety of resources, saving time in finding or creating objects and sprites, despite us not utilize the assets besides sounds.
* Since our team has a background in Java, transitioning to Unity’s primary language, C#, is efficient due to the similarities in syntax and structure.
* We also sought the challenge of using a full-featured game engine to gain hands-on experience with its functionality, enabling us to build a comprehensive game with a custom graphical user interface.
